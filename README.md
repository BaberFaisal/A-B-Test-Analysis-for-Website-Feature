---

##  Objective

To evaluate whether the newly introduced website feature leads to a statistically and practically significant increase in user conversions compared to the control version of the site.

---

##  Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Generation**  
   Simulated data for 5,000 users in each of the Control and Treatment groups over a 14-day test duration.

2. **Data Cleaning and Validation**
   - Checked for missing data 
   - Verified unique user assignment to groups   
   - Removed illogical records where clicks > page views  
   - Outliers acknowledged for mock data 

3. **Key Metrics Calculation**
   - Conversion Rate = Conversions / Users  
   - Observed metrics for Control and Treatment groups  
   - Lift calculation (relative improvement)

4. **Statistical Significance Testing**
   - Used Z-test for proportions  
   - Calculated p-value and 95% confidence interval  
   - Hypothesis testing conducted

5. **Power Analysis**
   - Computed effect size and statistical power  
   - Confirmed adequacy of sample size

6. **Practical Interpretation**
   - Evaluated uplift significance  
   - Provided rollout recommendations
